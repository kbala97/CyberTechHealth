"Threat Modeling: Designing for Security" is an excellent book that begins with an introductory perspective and gradually builds toward more complex concepts, supported by real-world examples. It’s valuable for a wide range of readers, including security architects, developers, and product managers. As you progress through the chapters, the importance of working with a cross-functional team to perform effective threat modeling becomes increasingly clear. Overall, it’s well written, practical, and genuinely enjoyable to read.
