An excellent introduction to security architecture and threat modeling, this book provides practical insights into designing secure systems. It covers essential concepts and methodologies that are crucial for anyone involved in system design and security.
I liked the clear explanations and real-world examples that make complex topics accessible. The book emphasizes the importance of integrating security into the design process from the outset, which is a critical aspect often overlooked in many projects.
